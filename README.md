# Find Duplicates

## Adobe Lightroom Plug-In

This is a simple plug-in that finds duplicate photos (or videos) in Adobe Lightroom catalog, matching by the basename of each selected file.
The duplicates it finds are added to a new collection named `Found Duplicates by Name`.

## Getting Started

Adobe Lightroom plug-ins are written in a subset of the [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) language.
